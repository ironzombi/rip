 Ruby IP command

 Because I still get:
 command not found: ip

 well this fixes that.

 Obviously not as functional as ip command on Linux,
 infact its barely functional at all.

<pre>
ip                  -- lists available interface names
ip -a               -- lists all avaialble info for available interfaces
ip -l               -- lists available interfaces only
ip -n               -- lists interface netmask information
</pre>


 why does this even need a README.md ?
